## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Backlog.md must build and run through Nix using the current bun2nix v2 workflow. Design the Nix package from the product requirements rather than preserving the existing implementation: install dependencies reproducibly, build the CLI and browser assets the repository actually needs, expose a runnable flake app and package, and verify the produced package on supported systems. Map that clean design onto the repository, implement the missing pieces, and remove superseded Nix machinery.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 The default Nix package builds and the packaged backlog executable runs --version and a representative CLI command on x86_64-linux
- [x] #2 nix run from a source revision runs the Backlog.md version from that revision
- [x] #3 Dependencies are locked and installed reproducibly with the current bun2nix v2 API and a documented deterministic update command
- [x] #4 The Nix package contains the CLI and functional browser assets required by the normal product build
- [x] #5 The flake exposes a working default package, named package, default app, and development shell on x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, and aarch64-darwin
- [x] #6 The x86_64-linux package runs on pre-AVX2 CPUs through a baseline Bun runtime without using that runtime as a compiler self-image
- [x] #7 Superseded bun2nix v1 files, Docker-based lock generation, package-install side effects, and obsolete Nix workarounds are removed
- [x] #8 CI builds the Nix package and runs packaged CLI and browser smoke checks plus an older-x86 runtime gate on native x86_64-linux
- [x] #9 Nix installation, supported systems, older-x86 support, and dependency-lock update documentation match the implemented workflow
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 bunx tsc --noEmit passes when TypeScript touched
- [x] #2 bun run check . passes when formatting/linting touched
- [x] #3 bun test (or scoped test) passes
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Pin bun2nix v2, regenerate bun.nix in the v2 schema, and use fetchBunDeps plus the documented copyfile backend for an offline dependency install.
2. Extend the existing Bun build script with a non-compile bundle mode so Nix packages the CLI module and generated browser assets from the same production entrypoint. Keep normal release compilation unchanged.
3. Package that bundle with bun2nix.mkDerivation and a Nix-managed Bun runtime. Use current Nixpkgs Bun on ARM systems and the version-matched official baseline Bun for dependency installation, non-compile bundle generation, development, and runtime on x86_64 Linux. Never create a Bun compiler self-image in the Nix package.
4. Expose the default and named package, default app, and development shell on x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, and aarch64-darwin.
5. Remove the v1 lock path, Docker update script, package-install side effect, and obsolete workarounds.
6. Add native Linux packaged CLI/browser smoke plus a discriminating Ivy Bridge no-AVX2 execution gate, update Nix usage and lock-update documentation, and run repository-wide validation.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Alex approved x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, and aarch64-darwin and requires retaining pre-AVX2 x86 support. bun2nix v2 provides fetchBunDeps and mkDerivation for the repository lock and build. Its default Linux link backend is rejected by Nix store permissions in this dependency graph, so the package uses bun2nix documentation’s cross-platform copyfile backend. A direct compiled package was rejected after reproducing #801 on the exact new artifact even without the old baseline overlay or Nix fixup: the Nixpkgs Bun compiler self-image exited 133 before CLI startup. The accepted architecture produces a non-compile bundle from the existing build entrypoint and runs it with Nix-managed Bun. x86_64 Linux overrides only the current Nixpkgs Bun source map with the version-matched official baseline archive; the baseline binary is never used for compilation. The installed wrapper passed version, help, init, representative CLI, MCP, and browser HTML/CSS/JS/favicon smoke checks. It also executes the full CLI under QEMU’s Ivy Bridge CPU model with no AVX2. BUN_JSC_useJIT=false is limited to that emulated validation because Bun JSC crashes under QEMU user mode with JIT enabled, even for a one-line script; normal packaged execution retains JIT.

Final validation: bun2nix regeneration produced an identical bun.nix hash; TypeScript and Biome checks passed; the full suite passed 1,729 tests with 4 intentional skips and 0 failures; the normal compiled release smoke passed; flake evaluation exposed package, app, and development shell outputs on all three approved systems; flake check, Nix build, installed CLI/browser smoke, and nix run passed on x86_64 Linux. The older-CPU gate is discriminating: standard Nixpkgs Bun exits with SIGILL under QEMU Ivy Bridge while the official baseline runtime runs the packaged CLI. Remaining limitation: JSC JIT is disabled only for QEMU user-mode validation because the emulator crashes JSC with JIT enabled; native packaged smoke retains JIT.

Codex review found that bun2nix still selected Nixpkgs' normal AVX2 Bun for dependency installation and the noncompile build before the baseline wrapper was installed. Reopened finalization to make the x86_64 package evaluation use the version-matched baseline Bun for every bun2nix build phase, while retaining the normal Bun only as the QEMU negative control. This remains a JavaScript bundle build, not Bun compiler self-image creation.

Review repair validation: a fresh Nix build and install check passed after selecting the baseline Bun before bun2nix patch and dependency-install phases. The evaluated package derivation puts the baseline Bun first in nativeBuildInputs, prepends it before hook phases, and invokes its absolute path for bundle generation and installed smoke. The x86_64 development shell was instantiated successfully and command -v bun resolved to the baseline store path; that Bun also ran under QEMU Ivy Bridge. Standard Bun remains isolated to the negative control, where it exits with SIGILL.

Clarification: in the final repair, baseline Bun performs dependency installation and JavaScript bundle generation. The earlier statement that it is never used for compilation refers specifically to Bun --compile executable self-image creation, not ordinary JavaScript bundling.

Fresh Codex review found that the aarch64-darwin install check binds localhost for the packaged browser smoke but had not enabled Darwin sandbox local networking. Reopened finalization to add the standard Nix Darwin allowance without weakening or skipping the smoke.

Darwin sandbox repair validation: all-system flake evaluation passed for the package, app, and development shell on x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, and aarch64-darwin. The evaluated aarch64-darwin package derivation records __darwinAllowLocalNetworking=1 while retaining doInstallCheck and the browser smoke. A fresh x86_64-linux Nix build completed its package, browser, CLI, and older-CPU install checks; Biome and git diff checks also passed.

Fresh Codex review found that the older-CPU negative control references the complete Nixpkgs AVX2 Bun derivation. On a cache miss, that derivation can execute Bun during its own fixup and fail on a pre-AVX2 build host before Backlog's baseline runtime is tested. Reopened finalization to make the negative control consume only Nixpkgs' fetched AVX2 release archive.

AVX2 negative-control repair validation: the x86_64 package derivation now depends on the normal Bun fetchurl archive but not the complete normal Bun derivation; its sole Bun derivation resolves from the baseline archive. The install check gives the unpatched AVX2 archive a temporary glibc loader root, asserts the expected QEMU Ivy Bridge SIGILL exit 132, then runs the packaged baseline CLI successfully. A fresh Nix build completed all install checks, all-system flake evaluation passed, and the Darwin derivation retained local networking without acquiring Linux-only inputs.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Rebuilt Nix packaging from the current bun2nix v2 workflow, producing a reproducible runtime-wrapped CLI with browser assets and a runnable flake across the approved systems. Removed the v1 and Docker-era machinery, added CI and deterministic lock validation, and documented installation and maintenance. Verified with repository-wide checks, compiled and packaged smoke tests, nix run, and a discriminating pre-AVX2 runtime gate.

After Codex review, extended older-x86 support to source builds and the development shell by selecting baseline Bun before every bun2nix phase, then revalidated the package and shell under the Ivy Bridge gate.

Enabled Darwin sandbox localhost networking for the retained packaged-browser install check, verified in the evaluated Darwin derivation and with a fresh Linux package build.

Made the older-x86 negative control source-build-safe by testing the fetched AVX2 Bun archive directly and asserting its expected SIGILL, avoiding realization of the full AVX2 Bun derivation.
